/* 
  (Comment below from Scott Hardman)
  This will style all elements to have no space
  around the edges of the element by default and 
  have line spacing of all 140% of the font size 
  of the element.

  as well at the top of this document, the colour
  scheme of this website is muted orange/browns.

  the background and hover background for the nav
  links is (#ede6df) a very light brown.

  The background colours for sections, divs, the
  nav bar and a few other elements is (#cba267)
  a light muted orange.

  The image borders, nav link backgrounds, nav link
  hover text as well as a few others is (#48331d)
  a dark brown for colour contrast.

  This colour scheme is used because the colour
  brown in psychology reminds people of the earth
  nature and gives people a sense of comfort and
  security, this page is discussing Treaties so
  it is important to make users feel welcome in a 
  learning environment.

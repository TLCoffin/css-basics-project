        <h1>Treaties Today</h1>
        <p id="sub-text">
          Even though it has been many years since the treaty have been signed, treaties are still a prominent and important part of living in
          a place like where we do. They have changed throughout the years by adding to existing treaty territory also called adhestions.

          <h2>Adhesions</h2>
          <p>
            Treaty adhesions are a way to continue to discuss the terms of that treaty in the future of it's original lifespan and renegotiate
            what land belongs to which group. It is also a way of bringing in new people to the talks that were not able to bea part of them
            originally or people who werent born
          </p>
          <h2>Land Entitlement</h2>
          <p>
            Treaty land entitlement is the transfer of government or crown land to the first nations peoples and it turning into reserve land.
            A lot of reserve land is very remote and out of the way of busy towns and cities, where it is less useful to people living on it,
            if a land claim is filed with the land entitlement agreement First Nations can claim some urban reserve land that is very useful.

          <h2>Events of the Treaty Signing</h2>
          <p>
            The First Nations Peoples in the northern parts of Manitoba and the surrounding areas had heard of the four other<br />
            Treaties happening in the area and wanted to negotiate for one of their own Treaties for the protection and ownership <br />
            of their land. The government wasn't to keen on participating in this Treaty eventually entered into Treaty negotiations. <br />
            They would not talk to anyone north of the lake except for the Norway House Band because the crown had already decided <br />
            that they would be included. In 1875 two executive Manitoba council members were appointed to negotiate with the Treaty <br />
            bands around the lake, Morris and James McKay. The Treaty groups were not offered the same deal as the other treaties, <br />
            instead of a one-time payment of $12 and 640 acres of land per family, from Treaties 3 and 4, They were offered $5 and <br />
            only 160 acres of land per family. Their reason was "The lands surrounding lake Winnipeg were not as valuable" Apart <br />
            from this the rest of the negotiations were link the other numbered Treaties exept with much less room for negotiations. <br />
            Eventually an agreement was made and th government promised to maintain schools on reserve land as well as to pay $5 <br />
            per person, $15 per headman and $25 per chief, as well as a few other fees annually. The Treaty was signed in 1875-76 at <br />
            Lake Winnipeg.
